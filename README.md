** DEVELOPMENT HAS SLOWED DOWN **

Aim Assist is a quick, simple way to keep track of EPR/OPR bullets for Airmen and Supervisors.

#Description

Aim Assist uses a postgreSQL database running on an express server, with a React frontend for a simple, mobile friendly user interface. Our site navigates to the users' dashboard and shows a list of bullets that include the date and AIR (Action, Impact, and Result). To add a new bullet, users will click on the button 'Add Bullet' and fill out the proper information for it to pop up on their list below. Aim Assist uses a 'Delete' feature in case an Airmen no longer needs a specific bullet. 

On the left hand side bar, users can select to see their profile. Selecting the profile takes users to their information such as their ID/referal code, full name, email, password, and their role. If the user sees an error or needs to update their information, they can type in the specific field and click the button 'Submit update'. The only field you will not be able to change is your ID/referal code since this keeps track of you in the system specifically.

For users in a Supervisor role, they also have the ability to see their Airmen's bullet page as well and check what/how many bullets are being created. Airmen's names will be listed below the tab 'My Tracker'.
